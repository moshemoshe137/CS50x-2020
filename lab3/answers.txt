sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?: 
I measured:
    - 14.370s on 50k random
    - 11.263s on 50k reversed
    - 0.1986s on 50k sorted
Conclusion:
    - Only bubble sort is fastest with pre-sorted data. It is likely that after the first pass-thru of 50k values, no values were swapped and sort1 knew the list was sorted.

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: 
I measured:
    - 2.867s on 50k random (really makes me think merge sort because my god was that fast!)
    - 2.083s on 50k reversed
    - 2.171s on 50k sorted
Conclusion:
    The same speed for each, regardless of setup. Very fast every time. It is Merge Sort. 

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: 
I measured:
    - 7.358s on 50k random
    - 7.124s on 50k reversed
    - 7.888s on 50k sorted
Conclusion:
    Equally bad in all cases. It must be selection sort.
